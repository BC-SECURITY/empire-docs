# Plugin Menu

Plugins are an extension of Empire that allow for custom scripts to be loaded. This allows anyone to easily build or add community projects to extend Empire functionality. Plugins can be accessed from the Empire CLI as long as the plugin follows the [template example](https://github.com/BC-SECURITY/Empire/blob/master/empire/server/plugins/example.py). A list of Empire Plugins is located [here](https://github.com/BC-SECURITY/Empire/blob/master/empire/server/plugins/PLUGINS.md).

The Plugins Menu, is displays all of the currently loaded plugins available to the user. You will then need to call `useplugin` to be able to access the functionality of a plugin.
