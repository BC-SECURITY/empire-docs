# Chat Menu

The chat menu interacts with the chat server in Empire. This allows users to drop in and out of the chatroom by typing `chat`. The 20 most recent messages will be displayed when you login to the room. When you are ready to return to your previous task,type `back` and you return to your previous menu.
