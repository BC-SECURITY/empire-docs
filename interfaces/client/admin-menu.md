# Admin Menu

The admin menu is an administrative menu which gives the team server admin the options to manage users and server options. The admin menu can be accessed by typing `admin` into the console. Once on this page, the admin can add/remove users from the team server and can modify the types of obfuscation the agents will use.

Regular users will not be able to modify settings, but will have access to accessing the notes features. Notes allow users to record information within their session and have them stored on the server. They can access their notes from any session once they are sent to the server.
