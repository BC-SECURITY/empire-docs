# Client

## **Main Menu**

When first loading Empire-Cli, the user will be dropped into the main menu. The only command available is `connect`. The "short way" to connect is to load the server into config.yaml and call it like `connect -c localhost`. The "long way" to connect is to provide the host, port, username, password as parameters.

## **Chat Menu**

The chat menu interacts with the chat server in Empire. This allows users to drop in and out of the chatroom by typing `chat`. The 20 most recent messages will be displayed when you login to the room. When you are ready to return to your previous task,type `back` and you return to your previous menu.
