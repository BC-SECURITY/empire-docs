# Client

## **Main Menu**

When first loading the Empire client, the user will be dropped into the main menu. The only command available is `connect`. The "short way" to connect is to load the server into config.yaml and call it like `connect -c localhost`. The "long way" to connect is to provide the host, port, username, password as parameters.
